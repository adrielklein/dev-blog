Today marks just about my one month anniversary as a software developer at HedgeServ. This picture summarizes how I've felt about my day to day work so far:

As you can tell, it's been hard. I've been confused, incorrect, wrong, and clueless. However, I do believe that I'm slowly getting more comfortable with the job. The code slowly starts making more sense and I start feeling a little less stupid every day.

No one said it was going to be easy and while sometimes I feel hopeless, I'd much rather have it too challenging than not challenging enough. I'm ready for the continued struggle ahead.
